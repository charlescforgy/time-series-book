# Course Resources

## Primary Textbook

The primary resource we will use in this course is *Time Series Analysis and Its Applications, 4th ed.* by Robert Shumway and David Stoffer.

## Additional Resources

There are several other valuable resources for this course:

### 1. Time Series Forecasting in Python
**Author:** Marco Peixeiro

More of a "cookbook" than a textbook, it contains multiple valuable guides to implementing time series analysis in Python.

### 2. Forecasting: Principles and Practice, 3rd ed.
**Authors:** Rob Hyndman and George Athanasopoulos  
**Available online:** [https://otexts.com/fpp3/](https://otexts.com/fpp3/)

While the math and statistics are more basic than we will be using in this course, it is still a valuable introduction to multiple topics, particularly exponential smoothing.

### 3. Prof. Steve Brunton's YouTube Lectures
**Topic:** Fourier Analysis  
**Link:** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNC0jxb0OxE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNC0jxb0OxE)

An approachable but rigorous introduction to Fourier analysis.

### 4. Prof. Aric LaBarr's YouTube Lessons
**Topic:** Time Series (5-minute lessons)  
**Link:** [https://www.youtube.com/@AricLaBarr/playlists](https://www.youtube.com/@AricLaBarr/playlists)

### 5. tsa4-python GitHub Repository
**Link:** [https://github.com/borisgarbuzov/tsa4-python/tree/master](https://github.com/borisgarbuzov/tsa4-python/tree/master)

Ports the first three chapters of code from *Time Series Analysis and Its Applications, 4th ed.* from R to Python.

### 6. Kalman and Bayesian Filters in Python
**Link:** [https://github.com/rlabbe/Kalman-and-Bayesian-Filters-in-Python](https://github.com/rlabbe/Kalman-and-Bayesian-Filters-in-Python)

An online textbook with interactive notebooks providing intuitive explanations and demonstrations of Kalman filters.
