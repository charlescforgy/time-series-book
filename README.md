# Time Series Analysis for Data Scientists
## Charles Forgy, PhD

This online textbook grew out the course notes for a Time Series Analysis course at the University of Maryland, College Park given in the fall semester of 2025. This book aims to be largely self contained with references to more advanced texts when necessary.

Note the this book is under active construction. Expect addition material to be added throughout 2026.
