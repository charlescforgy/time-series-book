# Time Series Analysis vs. Forecasting

One aspect that time series share with broader data science is that we are interested both in understanding historical patterns and forecasting future values. Let's take a look at some of the methods and goals of each.

## Distinguishing Analysis from Forecasting

It's relatively easy to build competitions and leaderboards for forecasting. In constrast, it's difficult to objectively rank insight into historical patterns. For this reason, new data scientists often focus nearly exclusively on the forecasting portion of time series, with they're interest in analysis confined to its use to create forecasting models. 

While entirely understandable, this mindset misses the broader question of "What is the best way to help mu client or employer?". There are instances in which your goal as a data scientist is confined to improving forecasts to, say, ensure adequate cloud compute power is avialable. However, it is at least as common to be tasked with time series analysis as part of a broader project that requires insights into trends or causative factors. In such cases, highly interpretable pure analysis methods will generally provide far more value than exquisite but opaque forecasting methods. As always in data science, a thorough understanding of the business goals and use cases must precede any decisions of model choice.
