# Additional Resources
This online textbook is designed to be as self-contained as possible. Nevertheless, it is neither possible nor desirable to have a single work covering all aspects at all levels. The resources below contain additional background material and detailed derivations. 

## Recommended Textbook

For those looking to deepen their understandings of the mathematical and statistical underpinnings of time series analysis, I highly recommend *Time Series Analysis and Its Applications* by Robert Shumway and David Stoffer [](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-70584-7). However, data scientists new to time series analysis may find Shumway and Stoffer to be too abstract and lack sufficient real world applications. For this reason, you may consider Shumway and Stoffer to be the next level beyond the material in this textbook.

## Other Resources

There are many other valuable resources for learning time series analysis. I have found the following to be particularly useful:

### 1. Time Series Forecasting in Python
**Author:** Marco Peixeiro

In many ways the polar opposite of Shumway and Stoffer, [Time Series Forecasting in Python](https://www.manning.com/books/time-series-forecasting-in-python-book) contains multiple valuable guides to implementing time series analysis in Python but minimal statistical background.

### 2. Forecasting: Principles and Practice, 3rd ed.
**Authors:** Rob Hyndman and George Athanasopoulos  
**Available online:** [https://otexts.com/fpp3/](https://otexts.com/fpp3/)

While the math and statistics are more basic than those covered in this textbook, it is still a valuable introduction to multiple topics, particularly exponential smoothing.

### 3. Prof. Steve Brunton's YouTube Lectures
**Topic:** Fourier Analysis  
**Link:** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNC0jxb0OxE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNC0jxb0OxE)

An approachable but rigorous introduction to Fourier analysis.

### 4. Prof. Aric LaBarr's YouTube Lessons
**Topic:** Time Series (5-minute lessons)  
**Link:** [https://www.youtube.com/@AricLaBarr/playlists](https://www.youtube.com/@AricLaBarr/playlists)

Easily understood short lessons on multiple topics in time series analysis and econometrics.

### 5. tsa4-python GitHub Repository
**Link:** [https://github.com/borisgarbuzov/tsa4-python/tree/master](https://github.com/borisgarbuzov/tsa4-python/tree/master)

Ports the first three chapters of code from *Time Series Analysis and Its Applications, 4th ed.* from R to Python.

### 6. Kalman and Bayesian Filters in Python
**Link:** [https://github.com/rlabbe/Kalman-and-Bayesian-Filters-in-Python](https://github.com/rlabbe/Kalman-and-Bayesian-Filters-in-Python)

An online textbook with interactive notebooks providing intuitive explanations and demonstrations of Kalman filters.
