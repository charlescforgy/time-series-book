# Preface

Welcome to *Time Series Analysis for Data Scientists*! This online textbook grew out the course notes for a Time Series Analysis course at the University of Maryland, College Park given in the fall semester of 2025. This book aims to be largely self contained with references to more advanced texts when necessary. 

## Background

I was motivated to write this book due to frustration over not being able to find a text at a level I considered appropriate for data science students. On the one hand, there are multiple outstanding statistics texts covering the topic in great depth. However, the statistical and mathematical rigor of these texts can often cause students to become lost in the details without a solid understanding of what is being done and why. On the other hand, texts aimed at business students often go into too little depth for the purposes of data science and focus narrowly on econometrics applications. 

This text aims to plot a middle course. Statistical and mathematical derivations are provided with the aim of equipping students with an understanding of the motivations, designs, and limitations of various methods. However, we stop short of the level of rigor required for academic statisticians looking to derive novel methodologies. Where necessary, this book contains references to classics such as Shumway and Stoffer or Box and Jenkins for more advanced students looking for additional depth. This book also contains topics not commonly covered in many time series classes that can be valuable for practicing data scientists such as SIR models from epidemiology and deep learning methodologies.

I would ask that any instructor or lecturer who using substantial portions of the book please send me an email at `ccforgy@umd.edu` to help understand the contexts in which the book finds use.

## Contributing

This book is maintained at `https://github.com/charlescforgy/time-series-book.git`. If you find any errors of areas you'd like to see expanded upon I would be grateful if you open a pull request. If you are not comfortable with GitHub, you can also directly email me at `ccforgy@umd.edu`.

For anyone interested in getting more involved in this open source project to bring rigorous but applicable time series analysis tool to the public, there are two areas in particular for which we are looking for contributions:

    1. Translation into languages other than English
    2. Graphic and website design to improve layout and readibility

If you have other ideas for ways to improve the book feel free to drop me a line.

Best of luck in your time series journey!
