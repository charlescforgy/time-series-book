# 4.1 Introduction

In this chapter we will discuss reasons that a time series may be non-stationary and methods to convert it into a stationary series. We will cover three primary reasons a time series may be non-stationary:

1. Presence of a trend
2. Presence of seasonal differences
3. Presence of a unit root

We will also cover three methods to convert a non-stationary time series into a stationary one, loosely paralleling the three causes above:

1. Detrending
2. Seasonal adjustment
3. Differencing

We will conclude the chapter with a brief overview of other reasons for non-stationarity such as increasing variance and methods to correct it.
