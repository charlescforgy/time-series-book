# 5.2 Classical Decomposition

## Components of Time Series

Many time series contain of a [trend](../chapter_4_enforcing_stationarity/02_trend.md#definition-of-trend), [seasonal effects](../chapter_4_enforcing_stationarity/04_seasonality.md#seasonality-definition), and/or [cycles](../chapter_4_enforcing_stationarity/04_seasonality.md#seasonal-vs-cyclic-changes). *Time series decomposition*, or simply *decomposition*, is defined as methods to isolate each component's contribution to an overall time series. Since cycles lack a specific length it is difficult to draw a clear distinction between an upward trend followed by a downward trend and a cycle. Consequently, we will generally fold cycles into the trend for the purposes of decomposition.

:::{note} Trends and Cycles in Decomposition
Most time series decomposition methods combine trends and cycles into a single component known as the "trend-cycle," or often merely as the "trend."

Before diving into the details, let's get a feeling for what a time series decomposition might look like.

US employment rate from the [Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/UNRATENSA) with STL decomposition consisting of original series (top), trends and cycles (second from top), seasonal contribution (third from top), and residual variation not explained (bottom).

We'll delve into the algorithms used to create figures like {ref}`stl-decomp-unemployment` below and in subsequent chapters. For now, let's take a moment to understand the components depicted in {ref}`stl-decomp-unemployment`.

1. $T_t$: The trend component, consisting of both trends and cycles in the data.
2. $S_t$: The seasonal
